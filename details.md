# Details

## Goal

Rate ICPC-style problems by difficulty from contest standings alone (no native
contestant rating, unlike Codeforces/AtCoder). Strategy is described in
`strat.tex` (concise) and `strat_detailed.tex` (gentle long-form). This repo
implements **Architecture A — the alternating fixed point** (strat.tex §3).

## Data

`data/standing_added.json` — 43 contests, 11,621 standing rows, 568 problems.
Per standing row: `rank`, `team_id`, `members`, `total_solved`, and per-problem
`{solved, score, time_seconds, wrong_attempts}`. This yields the model inputs
`y_tp` (solved), `tau_tp` (solve time), `r_{t,c}` (rank).

## Architecture A (`arch_a/`)

Abilities `theta_t` and difficulties `b_p` define each other, so they are solved
by alternation, then problems are rated with the converged abilities.

- `load.py` — parse JSON into flat numpy arrays + index maps.
- `elo.py` — the Elo-inversion primitive: logistic `pi(theta,b)` (s≈173.7) and
  `weighted_rating` (bisection, strat Def. 1). Also `performance_rating`.
- `fixedpoint.py` — Algorithm 1: loop {performance rating (eq. perf) → ability
  update (eq. update)} to a fixed point, then rate problems (eq. bp).
- `run.py` — wires it together, writes `output/problem_ratings.json`, runs the
  verification checks.

Run with the project venv:

### Key decisions

- **Scale anchor / no Codeforces data.** The strat's recommended anchor and
  bootstrap (eq. cfprior) use the Codeforces ratings of team members. **The data
  contains no CF ratings, and `members` are real names, not handles**, so CF
  anchoring is not available. Instead we anchor with a **constant neutral prior
  `MU0 = 2000`** (a mid Codeforces rating) for every team. This replaces the
  plan's original "center to mean 0", which is incompatible with the clamp below
  (centering would push half the teams under the floor mid-loop). Outputs are
  therefore a relative scale pinned near 2000, *not* certified CF-equivalent
  points.

- **Evidence-weighted prior (deviation from strat eq. update).** The strat blends
  `0.5*(rho + theta_prior)` per contest. With a *constant* MU0 that 0.5 weight
  never washes out — even a 40-contest team stays pinned halfway to MU0 — which
  flattens every contest's mean ability toward MU0 and defeats cross-contest
  normalization. We instead treat MU0 as a single pseudo-contest of strength
  `PRIOR_STRENGTH = 1.0`:
  `theta = (w_t*sum_c rho_c + PRIOR_STRENGTH*MU0) / (w_t*N_t + PRIOR_STRENGTH)`.
  A one-contest team leans on MU0 (cold start); a veteran is driven by its own
  performances (tourist: 2722 → 3634). Measured effect on normalization: with the
  old 0.5 blend, removing *all* cross-contest linking barely moved ratings
  (corr 0.99, mean shift 73 pts) — the prior did the anchoring. With the
  evidence-weighted prior, an unlinked contest collapses to exactly MU0
  (per-contest mean-theta std 3.7), and linking lifts small elite fields by
  300–480 pts (mean rating shift 267 pts): the **shared teams now drive
  normalization**, which is the whole point of the linking graph (§6).

- **Reliability weight from total contests (deviation from strat eq. weight).**
  The strat's experience weight `1 - 0.9^(n+1)` grows with accumulated history n.
  We use a single per-team weight from its *total* contest count,
  `w_t = 1 - 0.9^(N_t)` (one-off team → 0.1, veteran → ~1), applied in both the
  ability update and the difficulty estimate. Simpler, and needs no contest
  ordering (most `year` fields are null anyway).

- **`theta` / `b` clamp `[800, 4000]`** (close to the Codeforces range). This is
  also the floor/ceiling the strat prescribes in §3.2: problems solved by all (and
  rank-1 teams) have no finite root and pin to the relevant bound; problems solved
  by none pin to 4000. (Difficulty and performance map to the bounds in opposite
  directions, since rank 1 is the *best* result.)

- **Team identity = roster (member set), resolved by union-find.** Two id
  regimes exist: stable ids (`ucup-*`, a few bare ids) that denote one team
  across contests, and `$DEFAULT_DAT_PREFIX_*` ids from domjudge (the 35 official
  ICPC regional standings) that are **local to each contest** — of 475 recurring
  DEFAULT ids, 472 carry a different team name each time, so the same id is
  different teams. The roster is the reliable identity:

  - ~1,000 domjudge teams play 2+ regionals (up to 6); keying by member set links
    **2,716 appearances** that the DEFAULT ids leave as isolated islands.
  - team_name is *not* reliable — 33% of these teams vary their display name
    across regionals (punctuation, transliteration, renames), while the roster is
    constant (e.g. `0_GB_RAM` across 6 regionals; one Chinese team appears as
    `兄弟,我想拿牌` / `兄弟，我想拿牌` / `量大一队-…`).
  - 60–63 domjudge teams also recur in the Universal Cup, so roster-keying welds
    regional appearances onto rich UCup histories (e.g. *Rubikun*).

  `load.member_identity` builds a union-find over {stable id, roster token},
  unioning the two whenever they co-occur in a row. A row resolves to: its
  roster's component if it has **≥2 members** (the ≥2 guard avoids merging
  distinct teams on a single shared name — 72 one-member rows); else, for a
  domjudge id, an isolated per-contest key (1,476 no-member + 72 one-member rows
  that nothing identifies); else the stable id's component. This keeps a UCup
  team together even when its roster is missing from some rounds. Result: 7,902
  raw team keys collapse to **6,164 identities** (4,354 roster-identified, 1,598
  multi-contest; 1,548 domjudge-isolated). All 43 contests remain one connected
  component.

- **Granularity:** per resolved identity (roster where available, else stable id).
  True individual-level modelling (strat Remark on roster changes) is a follow-up.

### Results (current run)

- Converges in ~15 iterations, monotone decreasing `max|dtheta|` < 0.5.
- `theta` ≈ [1561, 3634], mean ~2018; veterans reach realistic levels
  (tourist θ≈3634) now that the prior washes out with evidence.
- `b` ≈ [1266, 4000], mean ~2462; zero-solve problems pin to 4000.
- Per-contest Spearman(difficulty, solve_count) median **−0.995** (harder
  problems were solved by fewer teams, as expected).
- Cross-contest normalization is now carried by the shared teams (see the
  evidence-weighted-prior decision): per-contest mean ability spreads to std≈110
  vs ≈3.7 with linking removed.

### Caveat introduced by the stronger normalization

Because an unlinked contest now collapses to MU0, a contest's absolute scale
depends entirely on its *linked* teams. Contests dominated by domjudge-isolated
teams (the large 500+-team Chinese regionals, where many rows have no usable
roster) are anchored by their minority of multi-contest teams, so their scale is
noisier than a UCup-heavy contest's. The graph is fully connected and every
contest has linked teams, so this is a quality gradient, not a break — but it is
the price of letting the shared teams, rather than the prior, set the scale.

## Out of scope / follow-ups

- **Architecture B** — joint Rasch / 2PL item-response model (strat §4) with
  Gaussian priors and uncertainty (MAP / MCMC / VI).
- **Solve-time survival likelihood** (strat §5) — uses `tau_tp` and contest
  length `T_c`; currently `tau` is loaded but unused.
- **Member-level identity** and entity resolution across sources (strat
  Remarks), to densify linking and handle roster changes.
- **External validation** against problems with a known editorial difficulty or
  a rated-judge mirror.
- **CF anchoring** if member→handle→rating data becomes available, to turn the
  relative scale into true Codeforces-equivalent points.
